            <div>
                <p>The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language
                    designed
                    specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It
                    is
                    very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”. </p>
                <p>PHP was introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in the first version and participated in the later versions. It
                    is
                    an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler.</p>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP code is executed in the server.</li>
                    <li>It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL,
                        PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Informix.</li>
                    <li>It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control
                        user access.</li>
                    <li>It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.</li>
                    <li>Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.</li>
                    <li>One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML
                        codes can also be written in a PHP file.</li>
                    <li>The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are
                        executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are
                        first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.</li>
                    <li>The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the
                        PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files
                        can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.</li>

            <div>
                <p>PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend
                    of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work
                    with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails, etc. There are also many
                    hash functions available in PHP to encrypt users’ data which makes PHP secure and reliable to be
                    used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of PHP’s abilities that make it suitable
                    to be used as a server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in
                    further tutorials. </p>
                <p>Even if the above abilities do not convince you of PHP, there are some more features of PHP. PHP can
                    run on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. Almost all of the major
                    servers available today like Apache supports PHP. PHP allows using a wide range of databases. And
                    the most important factor is that it is free to use and download and anyone can download PHP from
                    its official source: <a href="https://www.php.net/" target="_blank">www.php.net</a>. </p>
